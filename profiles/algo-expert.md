## About Me

I'm a sophomore computer science student with a passion for algorithms and data structures. Currently focused on competitive programming and building efficient solutions to real-world problems. I enjoy breaking down complex challenges and finding elegant algorithmic solutions.

## Skills

- [x] Python
- [x] Data Structures & Algorithms
- [x] C++
- [x] Git & GitHub
- [x] AI-Assisted Development

## Current Projects

1. **Algorithm Solutions Hub** - Curated collection of optimal solutions to classic problems with detailed walkthroughs
2. **DSA Practice Platform** - Building an interactive learning platform for mastering data structures and algorithms
3. **Open Source Contributions** - Contributing to algorithmic libraries and optimization tools

## AI Tools I'm Learning

- GitHub Copilot: Using it to quickly prototype solutions and explore different algorithmic approaches
- Claude: Asked for help optimizing code complexity and understanding advanced algorithmic concepts

## Fun Fact

I've been solving algorithm puzzles since high school and love the "aha!" moment when a complex problem suddenly clicks into place. Outside of coding, I'm an avid chess player!

## Goals for 2026

1. Master advanced algorithms (DP, graphs, and game theory)
2. Contribute to 3+ algorithm-focused open-source projects
3. Publish detailed algorithm tutorials and blog posts
