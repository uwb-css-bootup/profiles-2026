## About Me

I'm a developer working on stuff that probably breaks in production. Currently learning how to use git with AI so I can blame my mistakes on the AI instead of myself.

## Skills
<!-- Peak professional abilities -->
- [x] Advanced Rubber Duck Debugging
- [x] Coffee-to-Code Conversion (85% efficiency rate)
- [x] Stack Overflow Copy-Paste Specialist
- [x] Meeting-Attendance Excellence
- [x] Pretending to understand what DevOps people say

## Current Projects

1. **git-blame-shift** - A tool to automatically blame your commits on the AI assistant

## AI Tools I'm Learning
<!-- My AI journey so far -->
- GitHub Copilot: Helps me write code faster, which means I can break things faster
- Claude: Used it to write this entire profile because apparently I have no interests to share 😅

## Fun Fact

I don't have any interests... just kidding, I have plenty of interests! But I'm too mysterious to share them. (Translation: I forgot what I was doing before I opened this file)

## Goals for 2026

1. Master git without accidentally deleting the entire repository
2. Write code that works on the first try (realistic? probably not)
3. Figure out what "merge conflicts" actually mean
